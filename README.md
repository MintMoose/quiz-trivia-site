## What i Learnt

This solo project allowed me to create a react app without a solution given to me at the end.\
Doing this project reinforced the fundamental concepts of React as i came to the end product from independent research and past knowledge learnt from tutorials.

## Improvements

Correcting the opentdb api data and structured css to make the site friendly/dynamic for different devices would finalise this project.
